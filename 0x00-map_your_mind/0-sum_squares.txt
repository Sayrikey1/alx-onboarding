This program calculates the sum of squares of a given set of numbers


x = input_function( Takes in the set of numbers)


function TSS ( x -- enters the function as input ){
   
   y = A reserved storage list (takes in numbers)
     
   Calculate the mean of the set of numbers (i.e of x)

   for (every number in the set of numbers -- x){
       Subtract the calculated_mean from each number
       Square the result of the subtraction operation prior to this
       The result of the squaring operation prior to this, is sent to be stored in y
       }
   
    Then sum all the items stored in y
    print the result of the summing operation

    end

}
