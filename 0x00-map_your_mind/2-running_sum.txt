This program calculates the running sum of a given set of numbers

x = input_function( Takes in a set of numbers)


function running_sum ( x -- enters the function as input ){
   
    y = A reserved storage list (takes in numbers)
    
    for (every number in the set of numbers -- x){
        if, number is a nrgative number--stop

        else, store the number in y
        end
        }
     
    sum all numbers in y
    print the sum of numbers stored in y
    end
